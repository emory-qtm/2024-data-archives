# Quantitative Literary Analysis: Data and Archives
**Emory University / ENG 790 & QTM 490 / Fall 2024**

How can we analyze early American cultural archives through digital humanities methods? What new knowledge can these methods reveal? What are their limits? This course, which brings together English PhD students with advanced QTM undergraduates, will explore these questions in theory and practice. We will read scholarship about data and archives from the fields of literary studies, history, critical data studies, Black studies, Indigenous studies, gender studies, and more, and then work as class to produce a series of computational analyses of the digitized materials of [The Founders Online](https://founders.archives.gov/), part of the US National Archives. (We will also read several primary texts from this era along the way). Our computational and archival work will inform a miniseries on the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States being produced by Alabama Public Television.
